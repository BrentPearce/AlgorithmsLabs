Given I am still a student at the University of Wyoming, the above screen shot gives only a preview of my work for the lab section of Algorithms. If you are a potential employeer who would like to see my JS and HTML source code used in the labs for COSC 3020 Algorithms you can contact me at bpearce2@uwyo.edu, and I would be happy to send you the rest.

Cheers!
